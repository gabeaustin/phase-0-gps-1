# Gabe Austin's Reflection Questions

* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Prior to the GPS session I was struggling with the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`. I found out during the session that `git pull` will pull down all of the changes and merge them at the same time. Whereas, `git fetch` will pull the changes to your local machine but create a new branch in the process.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The difference between `git pull` and `git fetch` was clarified.


* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked the guide and my pair about best practices when merging branches. I wanted to know if most developers added comments in the comments section when completing a merge.


* **What still confuses you about Git?**

Merge conflicts still confuse me a bit. I think I will have to continue practicing to see what to look out for. Especially if I am working on a large project with a full team. I am sure the merge conflicts at that point could become frustrating.


* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

My first experience was great! Since this was my first pair session, I didn't know what to expect. But, my pair and my guide was very helpful. They both gave me little tips to help with saving time while developing. Also, my pair was very eager to learn new concepts and I was able to feed off of his energy.
