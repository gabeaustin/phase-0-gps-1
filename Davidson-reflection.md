##Answer these questions in your reflection:

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had only worked through the workflow once before the GPS, but I understood the general principals.  It was just the actual syntax of what I was doing that I struggled with.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
FETCH and MERGE were completely new - Aji was great at explain them and when they are useful and when to use them.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?  Fetch and Merge were one.  We talked alot about how these sessions flow and what we thought would work best.  I used Gabe to clarify what I was doing; probing him to continuiously check my understanding.

* What still confuses you about Git? Conflicts.  I understand why and how they happen, but when we were trying to complete Release5 after Aji had left the call, we had trouble getting the conflict to happen (doesn't sound like a bad thing, right?)

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? Overall, productive and welcoming.  I have to admit that I was a bit nervous to see how this was going to pan out, but Gabe and I were able to build a great relationship in just an hour, even setting up time to work together in the future.  Having the guide as a mentor to sort of steer the direction of the learning was invaluable and much appreciated.
